Creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and an Architecture Design Document (ADD) serve crucial purposes in the development process.
The PRD outlines the product's goals, features, and user requirements, providing a clear roadmap for the development team.
It ensures alignment between stakeholders, developers, and designers, leading to a well-defined and cohesive product vision. 
The ADD, on the other hand, lays out the technical architecture, system components, and integration strategies.
It serves as a blueprint for implementation, fostering collaboration, reducing ambiguity, and enabling effective communication across the development team. 
By investing time in these documents, you gain improved project clarity, efficient development processes, 
minimized miscommunications, and enhanced chances of delivering a successful product that meets user needs and expectations.
